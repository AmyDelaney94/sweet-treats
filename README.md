# Sweet Treats

Sweet Treats is a website that aims to create an online baking recipe community. This site allows users to share their favourite bakes with others as well as explore the site for new and exciting recipes that they can try at home.

Users can login, post their recipes, comment on posts by other users, edit posts they have previously uploaded, and like posts that have been uploaded by others. 

A link to the deployed website can be found <a href="https://sweet-treat-recipes.herokuapp.com/" alt="link to deployed heroku wedsite">here</a>.
