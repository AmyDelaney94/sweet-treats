# Sweet Treats

Sweet Treats is a website that aims to create an online baking recipe community. This site allows users to share their favourite bakes with others as well as explore the site for new and exciting recipes that they can try at home.

Users can login, post their recipes, comment on posts by other users, edit posts they have previously uploaded, and like posts that have been uploaded by others. 

A link to the deployed website can be found <a href="https://sweet-treat-recipes.herokuapp.com/" alt="link to deployed heroku wedsite">here</a>.

### Agile Design
- An Agile Approach was used to develop this site. This was achieved by breaking the project down into smaller tasks. 

To complete the overall aim of the Sweet Treats website concept, 14 issues were documented as specific tasks called User Stories. These User Stories are small sections of the project designed to accomplish a specific goal. 
The acceptance criteria I followed when completing this development project was that if when completing and testing each User Story, the task was completed sucessfully such as liking a post or logging in and out of the site then I deemed the passing conditions met. Once the User Story was working effectively it was moved across the Kanban board. 

As mentioned above this project used a Kaban board, which was set up in my <a href="https://github.com/AmyDelaney94/sweet-treats/projects/1" alt="link to Kanban Board">GitHub Projects here</a>, to help keep track of the work that was left to do,that was in progress and that was completed.

### Website Features

<!-- TOC --><a name="future-features"></a>
### Future Features
- Given more time I would create the option for the user to create and edit their own user profiles.
    - As part of this they could add profile pictures and a brief biography about themselves. 
    - The User profile would also contain a list of recipes created by the user.
